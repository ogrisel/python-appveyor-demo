python-appveyor-demo
====================

[![AppVeyor](https://img.shields.io/appveyor/ci/ogrisel/python-appveyor-demo.svg)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ogrisel/python-appveyor-demo/history)

Demo project for building Windows [Python wheels](http://pythonwheels.com/)
using https://appveyor.com. It supports both Python 2 and 3 on 32 and 64 bit
architectures.

AppVeyor is a continuous integration platform similar to travis-ci.org but for
the Windows platform. AppVeyor is free for Open Source projects and runs on the
Microsoft Azure cloud infrastructure.

This sample Python project has a simple C compiled extension (statically
generated from a Cython source file in this case). The build itself is
configured by in the `setup.py` file.

This project is meant to document a minimalistic yet working example to help
other Python project maintainers.


Continuous integration setup with AppVeyor
-----------------------------------------

The `appveyor.yml` file in this repo configures a Windows build environment for
both for 32 bit and 64 bit Python compiled extensions. This demo project is
configured to trigger build jobs at:

  https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ogrisel/python-appveyor-demo

In particular:

  - the `appveyor/install.ps1` powershell script downloads and
    installs Python and and pip to grab all the development dependencies of the
    project as registered in the `dev-requirements.txt` file.

  - the `appveyor/run_in_env.cmd` batch script configures environment variables
    to activate the MSVC++ compiler from the Windows SDK matching the Python
    version and architecture.

The content of the `dist/` folder (typically hosting the generated `.whl`
packages) is archived in the build report (see previous link).

**Note**: it is possible to activate the "Rolling builds" option to
automatically cancel build on intermediate push events to avoid clogging
the build queue with useless jobs. However it can be problematic as it can
cancel builds triggered by direct push to master outside of any PR. Instead
the `appveyor.yml` file of this repo uses a specific powershell snippet
to quickly fail if a newer build is queued for the same PR.


Building and testing locally from source
----------------------------------------

Here are the instructions to replicate the build steps manually.

Install developer dependencies (only nose and wheel at this time):

    pip install -r dev-requirements.txt

You can then build with:

    python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel

The generated source tarball and platform specific `.whl` package can be found
in the `dist` subfolder.

Install the `.whl` package with with:

    pip install dist/python_appveyor_demo-1.0-*.whl

Finally run the tests (from any folder by the source tree):

    nosetests -v pyappveyordemo

Under Windows will need a Windows SDK to build the compiled
extension with the MSVC++ compilers. See the following for details:
